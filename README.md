# What-happens-if-you-integrate-a-sawtooth-
You get a peculiar wave

# It's like a triangle
* but also like a sine wave
* It doesn't sound very bad and it's got alot of bite

# What happens if you integrate it again?
* You get a distorted sine wave
* It looks like a sine but has more harmonics
* But I don't know how to scale the amplitude to make it useful

# What happens if you difference it?
* Instead of adding you subtract 
* You get the same exact wave but upside down

# What happens when you multiply it?
* It cancles itself out and disappers
* nothing
